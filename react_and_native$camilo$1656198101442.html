    If your template.html file is just HTML and not a <i>React component</i>,
    then you can't require it in the same way you would do with a JS file.
    However, if you are using <a href="#">Browserify</a> — there is a transform
    called stringify which will allow you to require non-js files as strings.
    Once you have added the transform, you will be able to require HTML files
    and they will export as though they were just <em>strings</em>. Once you
    have required the HTML file, you'll have to inject the HTML string into your
    component, using the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop.
